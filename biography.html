				<p> I started playing guitar at the age of 12. But as for all musicien, the ground from which the learning process begins came earlier before, when I listened to the music that my relatives used to listen. And I could not deny how those songs marked my life, as musician and human being. To cite some exemples, I have a clear memory of hearing, in a family trip, to Raul Seixas’s « Metamorfose ambulante ». Other Bossa Nova songs and specially some of Tom Ze and Ze Ramalho also composed my childhood. But as lifely as those, I remember putting « Patience » of Guns n’ Roses because that sibbling at the begnning with the guitar’s melody just turned my mind. 
And definitely, when it comes about influences, Guns n’ Roses was by far the first most important one that stretched me to play guitar. It seemed that all the possible knwon and unknown agressivity that a 12 y .o. child could keep inside finally found a way to be lived, consciously touched without fear through the music. 
But it was not only about violence : those guitar solos meant much more. A melody that seemed to be built vagarously, in a perception of fullness that I only felt once when listening to an orchestra concert in a theater. As if any possible gap of disattention that one may have between 2 consecutive notes would never exists there. Note after note, the coherence that linked intensity with concentration created a space that was continous, extending my whole body to a simbiotic existence with those sounds coming from nowhere.
Afterwards, during my undergraduation studies, I discovered another giant : Led Zeppelin. This changed my relation with the music. The dissonant became possible and powerful as a langage expression of the uncertainities hidden somewhere, shy to be shown. 
Next, during my living in a foreign country, I met Stevie Ray Vaughan. I already knew this guy. But it was only in 2014 that I had a talk with him. And I discovered something completely new yet simple. It was, somehow, the gate that must be opened to finally put everything, everything from a caos to the delicate and warm edges of a japanese wood artifact in the same flow, in the same single person. An energy that dazed from raw to the most beautiful and deep feeling that arised from the deepest place of us, something called soul, immaterial, soft yet rude. Where the active contemplation meets peace in an unstoppable invitation to stay and to be with a joyness, a naive smile calling to continue, to do more, to go ! Running, the wind plays cheerfully with the long hairs and an unexplanable desire to laugh arises… the energy flows so integer that the body has no more weight, and the legs move freely by their own.

					And once I felt what was SRV, I had the pleasure to know other incredible musician, called Jeff Beck. Not too much word to describe him. One described his performances as "incredible as usual" . And it is interesting to me to observe how much sense it has when he was presented to me. Because after all the contundent explosion and unstoppable flux of energy presented in SRV, Jeff invites us to wrap all the feelings that we have and put then, calmly in a thread of breath that goes from relax to an gorgeous and ripping agressivity, much often with a great touch of complexity. 
It was time to assembly all the things that I could be. 
Now, silence. Something is reborning.
